# Face Recogniser
A piece of software to recognise my face

## Why is there no data?
I don't want to reveal the faces of random people or myself, so I have omitted the data.
If you would like to insert your own data, it is structured as such:
- nn/
  - data/
    - me/ (images of me)
    - notme/ (images of thing not me)
